There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.
You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
1. Each child must have at least one candy.
2. Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbours.
What is the minimum candies you must give?
Input Format:
The first and the only argument contains N integers in an array A.
Output Format:
Return an integer, representing the minimum candies to be given.
Example:
Input 1:
A = [1, 2]
Output 1:
3
def min_candies(A):
    n = len(A)
    
    # Initialize an array to store the number of candies each child gets
    candies = [1] * n
    
    # Traverse the array from left to right
    for i in range(1, n):
        if A[i] > A[i - 1]:
            candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1
    
    # Traverse the array from right to left
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if A[i] > A[i + 1] and candies[i] <= candies[i + 1]:
            candies[i] = candies[i + 1] + 1
    
    # Sum up the total number of candies
    total_candies = sum(candies)
    
    return total_candies

# Example usage:
A = [1, 2]
result = min_candies(A)
print(result)
output 3
