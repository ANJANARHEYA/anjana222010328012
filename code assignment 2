Say you have an array, A, for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e, buy one and sell one share of the
stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
Return the maximum possible profit.
Problem Constraints
0 <= len(A) <= 7e5
1 <= A[i] <= 1e7
Input Format
The first and the only argument is an array of integers, A.
Output Format
Return an integer, representing the maximum possible profit.
Example Input
Input 1:
A = [1, 2]
Input 2:
A = [1, 4, 5, 2, 4]
Example Output
Output 1:
1
Output 2:
4
def min_candies(A):
    n = len(A)
    
    # Initialize an array to store the number of candies each child gets
    candies = [1] * n
    
    # Traverse the array from left to right
    for i in range(1, n):
        if A[i] > A[i - 1]:
            candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1
    
    # Traverse the array from right to left
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if A[i] > A[i + 1] and candies[i] <= candies[i + 1]:
            candies[i] = candies[i + 1] + 1
    
    # Sum up the total number of candies
    total_candies = sum(candies)
    
    return total_candies

# Example usage:
A = [1, 2]
result = min_candies(A)
print(result)
output
3
